<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I like to use my free time to read a lot, meditate, or look for new ways to better myself such as 
    completing online courses on topics that interest me, to keep my mind active and continue to learn new 
    things. I have a strong interest in ecology and conservation which led me to joining the Open University 
    via distance learning, working towards a degree in Natural Sciences. I enjoy things that are either 
    creative, or that give me a challenge, whether itâ€™s physically or mentally.
    I am a member of multiple wildlife charities such as WWF, Kent Wildlife Trust, and The Woodland Trust, 
    as well as being a marine mammal medic for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, and hold a student 
    membership with CIEEM</p>
