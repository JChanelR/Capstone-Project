    <h2>All Season end of life Carer</h2>
        <p>At my brief time at All Seasons, I cared for people in their own homes who were at their end of life, 
            including those paralysed due to strokes, had double amputations, or had severe dementia. I had to aid 
            those who were unable to complete tasks such as feeding themselves, bathing, and dressing/undressing
            whilst keeping the dignity of the person. Each day would have a very tight schedule, and I had specific 
            training such as using specialised equipment to get someone in and out of a chair or bed who is 
            paralysed or amputated. My day included getting people in and out of bed for the day, bathing them,
            cleaning soiled beds, dealing with confused and sometimes aggressive client’s with dementia whilst 
            keeping calm, washing soiled underwear for those who were paralysed, ensuring clients take the correct 
            medication, and remembering each clients preferences on how their day is handled. This meant I had to 
            build good relationships with each client, have a strong stomach for soiled bedding/clothing, and keep a 
            level head when a client had passed.</p>
    <h2>The Dental Surgery and Dumpton Park Dental Surgery</h2>
            <p>My role at The Dental Surgery and at Dumpton Park Dental Surgery were both as a Dental Nurse. This 
                role comes with a lot of responsibility and a lot of specific knowledge. When not needed as a Dental 
                Nurse, my administrative and communication skills would be utilised by doubling as a receptionist. Being 
                a Dental Nurse meant making sure the practices day ran safely and efficiently, requiring good time 
                keeping and organising.

                        the required instruments and patient records, and flushing all pipes and filters. I also did this

    <h2>Next Retail</h2>
                <p>As a sales assistant my good customer service, communication skills and extensive knowledge in my 
                    department got me promoted to Menswear Specialist. This meant I had to be confident in my 
                    knowledge as I would be one of the first points of contact for customers or staff that had any questions.
